Saliency algorithms are used to identify the most "salient" or important regions in an image. These algorithms are typically used in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. There are various types of saliency algorithms, but most of them rely on computing the differences or contrasts between different regions of an image in order to identify the most salient regions. Some common methods include using color contrast, intensity contrast, and texture contrast to identify the most salient regions. Some popular saliency algorithms include the Itti-Koch saliency model, the graph-based visual saliency model and the deep learning based saliency models.
